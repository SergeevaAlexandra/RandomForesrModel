# RandomForesrModel
Dataset analysis and model selection

---

In this notebook, I will be exploring the dataset of the Titanic spaceship.

My goal is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension after a spaceship collision.

I will be using scikit-learn pipelines and RandomForestClassifier.

The accuracy score of my model was 79.1%. Given the complexity of the task and the incompleteness of the dataset, I believe that this is a good result.
